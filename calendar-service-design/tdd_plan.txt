Order of TDD
1. White box tests for CalendarRequest
2. White box tests for CalendarEvent
3. White box tests for CalendarApiFirebase
4. Black box tests for Flask public endpoints

This order was determined based on dependencies of the Flask public endpoints
(step 4) on the first three steps, given that CalendarRequest, CalendarEvent
and CalendarApiFirebase implement functionality that is used by these endpoints.
Thus if these latter subcomponents are working as expected, any defects detected
by the black box tests can be narrowed down to the calendarApi file.
