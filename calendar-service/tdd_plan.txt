Order of TDD
1. White box tests for CalendarRequest
2. White box tests for CalendarEvent
3. White box tests for CalendarApiFirebase
4. Black box tests for Flask public endpoints

This order was determined based on dependencies of the Flask public endpoints
(step 4) on the first three steps, given that CalendarRequest, CalendarEvent
and CalendarApiFirebase implement functionality that is used by these endpoints.
Thus if these latter subcomponents are working as expected, any defects detected
by the black box tests can be narrowed down to the calendarApi file. Additionally,
the order within the first three steps were determined based on complexity, from
least complex to more complex, given that the CalendarRequest class is the simplest
of the three classes, and testing CalendarApiFirebase requires setting up a Firebase
emulator. This was done especially since this is my first time using pytest and other
test modules.
